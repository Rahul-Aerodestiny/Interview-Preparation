    <h2>ðŸ“˜ Basic Electrical Interview Questions</h2>
    <div class="qa-container">
      <div class="qa-card"><h3>1. What is the difference between AC and DC?</h3><p><strong>Ans:</strong> AC (Alternating Current) changes direction periodically, while DC (Direct Current) flows in one direction only.</p></div>
      <div class="qa-card"><h3>2. Explain Ohmâ€™s Law.</h3><p><strong>Ans:</strong> Ohmâ€™s Law states that Voltage = Current Ã— Resistance (V=IR).</p></div>
      <div class="qa-card"><h3>3. What are transformers used for?</h3><p><strong>Ans:</strong> Transformers step up or step down voltage levels in power systems.</p></div>
      <div class="qa-card"><h3>4. What is power factor?</h3><p><strong>Ans:</strong> Power factor is the cosine of the angle between voltage and current, showing efficiency of power usage.</p></div>
      <div class="qa-card"><h3>5. Difference between a generator and an alternator?</h3><p><strong>Ans:</strong> A generator produces DC or AC, while an alternator always produces AC.</p></div>
      <div class="qa-card"><h3>6. What is Kirchhoffâ€™s Current Law (KCL)?</h3><p><strong>Ans:</strong> KCL states that the algebraic sum of currents at a node is zero.</p></div>
      <div class="qa-card"><h3>7. What is Kirchhoffâ€™s Voltage Law (KVL)?</h3><p><strong>Ans:</strong> KVL states that the algebraic sum of voltages in a closed loop is zero.</p></div>
      <div class="qa-card"><h3>8. What is an inductor?</h3><p><strong>Ans:</strong> An inductor stores energy in the form of a magnetic field when current flows through it.</p></div>
      <div class="qa-card"><h3>9. What is the difference between a relay and a circuit breaker?</h3><p><strong>Ans:</strong> A relay senses and signals fault, while a circuit breaker actually interrupts current flow.</p></div>
      <div class="qa-card"><h3>10. What is an RLC circuit?</h3><p><strong>Ans:</strong> A circuit consisting of a Resistor (R), Inductor (L), and Capacitor (C) connected in series or parallel.</p></div>
      <div class="qa-card"><h3>11. Explain the concept of resonance in RLC circuits.</h3><p><strong>Ans:</strong> Resonance occurs when inductive reactance equals capacitive reactance, maximizing current.</p></div>
      <div class="qa-card"><h3>12. What is a synchronous motor?</h3><p><strong>Ans:</strong> A motor that runs at constant speed in synchronism with supply frequency.</p></div>
      <div class="qa-card"><h3>13. Difference between three-phase and single-phase systems?</h3><p><strong>Ans:</strong> Three-phase provides more power, efficiency, and smoother operation compared to single-phase.</p></div>
      <div class="qa-card"><h3>14. What are semiconductors used for in electrical systems?</h3><p><strong>Ans:</strong> They are used in rectifiers, transistors, diodes, and power electronics for switching and control.</p></div>
      <div class="qa-card"><h3>15. What is the function of a capacitor?</h3><p><strong>Ans:</strong> A capacitor stores electrical energy in an electric field and is used in filtering, power factor correction, etc.</p></div>
      <div class="qa-card"><h3>16. What is a rectifier?</h3><p><strong>Ans:</strong> A rectifier converts AC to DC.</p></div>
      <div class="qa-card"><h3>17. What is the difference between star and delta connection?</h3><p><strong>Ans:</strong> In star, line voltage = âˆš3 Ã— phase voltage; in delta, line voltage = phase voltage. Star is for long-distance transmission, delta for high current loads.</p></div>
      <div class="qa-card"><h3>18. What is load factor?</h3><p><strong>Ans:</strong> Load factor is the ratio of average load to maximum load over a period. Higher load factor indicates better efficiency.</p></div>
      <div class="qa-card"><h3>19. What is an isolator?</h3><p><strong>Ans:</strong> An isolator is a switch used to ensure circuit is completely de-energized for maintenance.</p></div>
      <div class="qa-card"><h3>20. What are harmonics in electrical systems?</h3><p><strong>Ans:</strong> Harmonics are voltage or current waveforms with frequencies that are integer multiples of the fundamental frequency, causing distortion.</p></div>
